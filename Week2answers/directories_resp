1. The command cd blah returns
 -bash: cd: blah: No such file or directory
2. The command cd .. moves back one directory
	pwd displays current directory path
3. I see a list of all the directories within the directory I am in.
4. cd returns to my default directory, which is ~
5. the command cd .. twice takes me back two directories
6. This directory is my personal directory, which has just the directory 
ATMS-305 within it, which I can see by typing in ls
7. cd root returns an error, as the root directory is not one that I can 
jump to without an exact path.  I only have access to the directories 
within the one I am in.
8. cd goes into the directory that is within the one I was just in.  I 
could type cd . to stay where I am.
